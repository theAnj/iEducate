            <p class="text-big">Culture and the environment.</p>
            <p class="text-small">The stability of the planet could be assisted through the mobilization of education, 
                and the diversification of knowledge, customs and culture.Research suggests that embedding a deep attachment to 
                landscapes and tangible heritage instils a sense of care for the world, and that the study, preservation and 
                appreciation of diverse languages, knowledge and customs enrich human collective consciousness through an understanding
                of the relations between past, present and future societies.
                Education plays a role by including sustainability studies as a means of promoting planetary survival. Earth science 
                and environment studies enable learners and communities to become more cognizant of the world they inhabit and leave behind them.
                A ‘community of knowledge’ is one in which the responsibility of being a ‘knowledge keeper’ is for everyone.This paradigm shifts
                 the focus from the perspective of ‘stakeholder’ and changes the way of contributing to knowledge, aiming to achieve sustainable 
                 development. The future of education may be to support the cognitive practices of the groups and communities which recreate the 
                 values of their environment through the practices of cultural appreciation and symbolic recognition of places.</p>

            <p class="text-small">With artificial intelligence, technology is increasingly involved in education. New digital competencies 
                and media literacies call for a gender transformative approach (promoting gender equality, sharing control of resources and 
                decision-making, and women's empowerment in digitization and use of artificial intelligence (AI).Unlocking digital 
                barriers through open educational resources enables global online learning and facilitate Education For All.
                Media and communication students would require ethics courses to establish their critical thinking skills and training. 
                This is seen as being crucial in a ‘fake news’ era when trust in media professionals is being eroded, especially when news 
                and documentary production is impacted by the capacity of artificial intelligence to manufacture authentic-looking ‘fake’ material. 
                For instance, researchers at the University of Washington have created algorithms based on hours of video footage and audio 
                recordings to create realistic lip-synced videos of Barack Obama.</p>

            <p class="text-small">UNESCO's Futures of Education initiative is intended to mobilize the many ways of 
                being and knowing to leverage humanity's collective intelligence. It relies on a consultative process that involves young people, 
                educators, civil society, governments, business and other stakeholders.The mobilization and contribution of the network of 
                UNITWIN/UNESCO Chairs is a key part of the process of engagement.The work is being guided by a high-level International 
                Commission of leaders from diverse fields and different regions of the world. The commission plans to publish a report in November 
                2021 designed to show how education and learning can enable individuals to become what they want to become.</p>
